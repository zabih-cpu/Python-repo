# sum is python
# a = 50
# b = 20
# sum = a+b
# print("sum of a and b is :",sum)


# arithmetic operator
# a = 5
# b = 4
# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a*b)
# # print(a % b) use for reminder



# relational/comparison operator
# a = 40
# b = 10
# print(a == b)
# print(a != b)
# print(a > b)
# print(a < b)
# print(a <= b)
# print(a >= b)


#assignment operator 
# num = 10
# num += 20
# num -= 20
# num *= 20
# num /= 20
# num %= 20
# print(num)

 
#logical operator
# val1 = True
# val2 = False
# print(val1 and val2) beause both are not the same(False) 
# print(val1 or val2)  beause one is true (True)
# print(not val2) (not will always give opsite val)so its is false

# type conversion OR type casting 
# a = int("3")
# b = 4.28

# sum = a+b
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(sum)

# Input in python 

# name = input("enter your name :")
# age = float(input("enter your age :"))
# marks = int (input("enter your marks :"))

# print(name)
# print(type(age),age)
# print(type(marks),marks)

# practice question (write a parogram to input two number and print sum)
# first = int(input("enter first number :"))
# second = int(input("enter second number :"))

# print("sum :",first + second)

# practice questuon (write a parogram to input a size of square and print the area )
# side = float(input("area are :"))

# print(side*side)

# # practice question (write a parograme input 2 floating point number and print thier average)
# float1 = float(input("first number :"))
# float2 = float(input("second number :"))


# print("average is :", (float1 * float2)/2)
